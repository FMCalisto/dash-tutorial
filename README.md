[Plotly](https://plot.ly/)’s [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) is an Open Source (OS) visualization framework that, combines several features and packs them into an easily accessible and deployable framework.

## About

The creation of this repository serves the purpose of the learning process regarding the [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) framework. It was developed by [Francisco Maria Calisto](http://www.franciscocalisto.me/) ([FMCalisto](https://github.com/FMCalisto)). The goal of this learning process was triggered by the need of gaining knowledge for the [WFex](https://github.com/opprDev/wfex) project. This repository is the result of following several tutorials. First of all, we follow the [Dash Tutorial - Part 1: App Layout](https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started). Second, we follow the [Using Plotly’s Dash to deliver public sector decision support dashboards](https://medium.com/a-r-g-o/using-plotlys-dash-to-deliver-public-sector-decision-support-dashboards-ac863fa829fb) at [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) by [Adriano Yoshino](https://medium.com/@iamyoshi).
